# InterfaceZero
**Interface Zero** is a tactile, minimalist icon system for Stream Deck and control surfaces. Icons are built as physical, matte-finished plates with consistent depth, lighting, and spacing, prioritizing clarity, hierarchy, and muscle memory across apps, admin, AI, and system actions.
